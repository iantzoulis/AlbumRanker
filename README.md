# AlbumRanker
This work in progress site is an album ranker that allows users to rank their favorite albums in an intuitive and functional way. It is currently being written in HTML, CSS (Bootstrap + Custom), JavaScript, and JQuery.

## To Do
These are a few of the features I would like to add in the future to improve functionality:
* Utilize local storage to automatically save the contents of a user's list
* Provide options for exporting the list as a JSON file and importing a previously exported list from the user's local storage
* Add functionality that will allow users to export the contents of their list as a JPEG file.
