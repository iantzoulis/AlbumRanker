# AlbumRanker
This work in progress site is an album ranker that allows users to rank their favorite albums in an intuitive and functional way. It is currently being written in HTML, CSS (Bootstrap + Custom), JavaScript, and JQuery.

## To Do
These are a few of the features I would like to add in the future to improve functionality:
* Add functionality that will allow users to export the contents of their list as a JPEG file.
